This is a very minimal react+redux boilerplate for new web projects. It makes use of very few
additional technologies:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) - to build a packaged file.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - to use Stage 0 features of JavaScript.
- [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and [Faucet](https://github.com/substack/faucet) - for
  running tests.
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), for simplified shallow rendering in unit tests.
